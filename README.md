This project investigates the problem of choosing the best backbone architecture for YOLOv8  in detection of INTERCO flags.
=======
This study investigates the optimization/choosing of backbone architecture selection for the **YOLOv8 model** in the context of detecting **INTERCO** maritime signal flags, with a focus on identifying the architecture that maximizes detection performance while balancing computational efficiency.

**Hypothesis:** Choosing the backbone architecture of YOLOv8 have impact.
